So, you wanna know more about me? Cool!

Let’s begin!

I’m the kind of person ~~who loves diving into different interests—always curious, always exploring~~. But when it comes to mastering something… well, let’s just say I tend to jump to the next thing before finishing the last.

As a Linux user (more specifically, Arch Linux!!!), I love programming, especially low-level stuff with C and Assembly. What can I show you? Eh… nothing yet. I start projects with motivation, but finishing them? That’s a different story—I usually get distracted by a new one.

My main hobbies:

+ Video games – Dota 2 and VRChat are the only online games I **DO** play. Everything else? Single-player all the way!

+ Chess – Been playing since I was six. DM me if you wanna play or find me on chess.com → **justforasecond**

+ Books – I read all kinds, but my favorites are fantasy (Tolkien & Martin — legends) and philosophy (Nietzsche & Plato).

+ Game development – Both as a developer and an industry enthusiast.

+ D&D – Started playing last year and loving it.

+ Physics & Quantum Physics – Hated them for years, then suddenly fell in love.

+ Mathematics – A beautiful puzzle I never get tired of.

Not sure how you see me after reading all this, but hey—thanks for stopping by!
