# Report Day 12-15

Tried to work with a team of people on the GameJam. I took responsobilities as an artist but it all went shitty. If someone who worked with me on that reads it, I'm really sorry.

After almost two spent days in **Krita** i came to the conlussion that mouse is a bad tool to draw. So, i order some small Graphical Tablet. Will be trying myself in that field. You could check my results -> [here](https://x.com/mhmrth1)

Also, wanted to share what i am currently studying.
+ **LÃ–VE2D** as a framework, and **LUA** as a language. (I hope to make it my main tool. Zero engines! (also, that's a fucking amazing tutorial: https://youtu.be/I549C6SmUnk?si=E0g_R_1dmnwHHMj2))
+ Practicing in **Krita**.
+ Making some small Visual Novels in **Ren'Py**. 
+ Some music staff in **Reaper**.

Another three days to ass
