# Report on nothing

By these two days, i have done almost nothing. Keep trying to get used to LOVE2D and C++. Also I'm currently trying to find experience in industry. 

I'm also have started working on small VisualNovel on Ren'Py. In few weeks i hope i'll finish it. Currently just finished main concept and script. 

- base of LOVE2D&LUA passed
- some basics of Krita learned
- Reaper staff reminded :)
