Hello there. Well, it was three since I've posted my last report. Shesh. Kinda embarrassed about it. 

Okay. Time flied really rapidly. 

From the main since I've learned since:

⋅⋅* I fell in love with graphics programming after some videos of [Acelora](https://www.youtube.com/@Acerola_t). 
    So, after watching a couple of their videos I started my learning journey with OpenGL, and I hope later I'll go with Vulkan. 
⋅⋅* I feel pretty comfortable with Java now.
    After almost a year of intense Java learning, I can confidently say that I'm done with it. Unfortunately I'll have to use it for the next few years.
    However, even ignoring my hate on Java, this language taught fucking amount of programming knowledge. 
    Thank you, and fuck you snail.
⋅⋅* My Blender journey also kept going. 
    I hit 10-12 hours in Blender. Donut and a try into re-making Orphan of Kos were my two big projects. 
    Hope to return to 3D Modeling in the future.

So, my goals. I will try to make a couple of things in the next few months. 

> My own compiler. 
> GameEngine for my needs.

In general, I'd like to make my GitHub and LeetCode profiles all green this summer. 
Thank you.
